gnindex
=======

Brief Info
----------

``gnindex`` is a search engine over collection of strings (combinations of
characters) that have been used as names for organisms. ``gnindex`` contains
many examples of names spelled in slightly different ways. It indexes
occurances of biological scientific names in the world, normalizes and
reconsiles lexical and taxonomic variants of the name strings.

``gnindex`` handles two type of queries over indexed name strings: resolution
and faceted search.

Faceted search accepts part of name string (canonical part, author word(s),
genus word(s), species word(s), year) possibly wildcarded or their logically
combined composition. In response it returns all results that satisfy given
request.

Resolution accepts a set of whole name strings with resolution parameters. Parameters
includes:

- raw string supplied to name input ("a label")
- data source IDs where ``gnindex`` should perform resolution
- should names be resolved in respect to context
- should ``gnindex`` resolve a name with vernacular

Installation
------------

``gnindex`` is dockerized:

.. code:: bash

    docker-compose up

``docker-compose`` pulls all necessary Docker containers (Postgres database
engine, ``gnindex`` matcher, nameResolver, facetedSearcher, api and front
services), initializes them, and listens for HTTP connections over 80 port with
paths as follows:

- ``/`` path returns user-friendly HTML interface
- ``/api`` returns `GraphiQL <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql>`_
  interactive in-browser environment to interact with ``gnindex`` API.

Using API
---------

``gnindex`` uses GraphQL interface to make requests to API. ``gnindex`` accepts
GraphQL requests at ``/api/graphql`` URL. It's simply a POST request with JSON
body of predefined format:

.. code:: json

  {
    "query": "BODY OF QUERY",
    "variables": "SUPPLIED VARIABLES",
    "operation": "SELECTED OPERATION"
  }

``gnindex`` API exposes GraphQL methods as follows:

- ``nameResolver`` for name resolution
- ``nameStrings`` for faceted search

Detailed documentation on input parameters and output could also be found in
documentation fetched from API and rendered by GraphiQL at ``/api``.

A simple GraphQL request might be:

.. code:: graphql

  query {
    nameResolver(names: [{value: "Homo sapiens"}], dataSourceIds: [1]) {
      results {
        name {
          id
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }

That returns result:

.. code:: graphql

  {
    "data": {
      "nameResolver": [
        {
          "results": [
            {
              "name": {
                "id": "7db4f8a2-aafe-56b6-8838-89522c67d9f0",
                "value": "Homo sapiens Linnaeus, 1758"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }

The request could be composed with ``cURL``:

.. code:: bash

  curl 'http://index.globalnames.org/api/graphql' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    --data-binary '{"query":"query {\n  nameResolver(names: [{value: \"Homo sapiens\"}], dataSourceIds: [1]) {\n    results {\n      name {\n        id\n        value\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n","variables":null}'

Forturately, it isn't necessary to encode GraphQL query string and to nest it
to parent JSON. Some languages provide `GraphQL clients
<http://graphql.org/code/#graphql-clients>`_ that do all dirty work.
Consider simple Ruby client to request ``gnindex`` API:

.. code: ruby

  def variables(names)
    { dataSourceIds: [1],
      names: names.map { |name| { value: name[:name], suppliedId: name[:id] } } }
  end

  RESOLVER_URL = "http://index-api.globalnames.org/api/graphql"
  http = GraphQL::Client::HTTP.new(RESOLVER_URL)
  schema = GraphQL::Client.load_schema(http)
  @client = GraphQL::Client.new(schema: schema, execute: http)
  @query = <<~GRAPHQL_QUERY
    query($names: [name!]!, $dataSourceIds: [Int!]) {
      nameResolver(names: $names, dataSourceIds: $dataSourceIds) {
        total suppliedId suppliedInput
        results {
          name { value }
          canonicalName { value }
          synonym
          matchType { kind score editDistance }
          taxonId classification { pathRanks }
          score { value parsingQuality }
        }
      }
    }
  GRAPHQL_QUERY
  names = ["Homo sapiens", "Phallomedusa solida"]
  res = GRAPHQL.client.query(QUERY, variables: variables(names))
  puts res

Project Structure
-----------------

The projects consists of 6 subprojects:

- ``common``
- ``matcher``
- ``nameResolver``
- ``facetedSearcher``
- ``api``
- ``front``

common
~~~~~~

Contains Thrift data structures that are shared between microservices.

matcher
~~~~~~~

The Thrift microservice expects canonical names of type ``Seq[String]`` and data sources IDs of
type ``Seq[Int]``. It tries to fuzzy match through all known canonical names and those stems
(according to Latin stemming) with Levenstein algorithm of edit distance 1.

It returns list of lists of found fuzzy matches UUIDs: one list per provided canonical name. Note
that it returns UUIDs only as it has no connection to database.

nameResolver
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Thrift microservice expects complex requests of type ``thrift.nameresolver.Request``. It passes
through stages for every provided name request:

1. Two UUIDv5 values are computed: first one is for provided name string, second one is for parsed
   canonical name. Then microservice tries to find records according to those two UUIDs
2. If nothing is found for exact match and name is not parsable, then empty result is returned
3. If provided name is parsable, then canonical form of the name goes to ``matcher`` microservice.
   Final results are formed based on database results matched by those UUIDs.

facetedSearcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Performs faceted search.

api
~~~~

The ``api`` microservice is connected with ``nameresolver`` and ``facetedSearcher`` microservices.
It provides ``GraphQL`` interface to the user. ``GraphQL`` requests are then translated to
microservices requests.

Development
-----------

Database schema creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database is created and migrated using ActiveRecord gem from
RubyOnRails package. Database is created in `sql` format, rather than `ruby`,
because it includes configuration of external Postgresql packages.

To create schema at ``./db_migration/db/structure.sql`` file run
``bundle exec rake db:migration``.

Testing
-------
